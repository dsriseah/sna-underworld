# sna-underworld
submission for New JAMshire 2024

UPDATE: This release uses the public release of [URSYS](https://github.com/dsriseah/ursys/) version 2025-0422, and no longer needs to live inside an URSYS framework to run.

### QUICK START

_tested under MacOS terminal_

> [!WARNING]
> This codebase was designed to work with Visual Studio Code and [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (nvm). For more details about my preferred setup, see the [URSYS installation](https://github.com/dsriseah/ursys/wiki/Installation) page. 

Open terminal and then...
```
cd <your_dev_directory>

git clone https://github.com/dsriseah/sna-underworld.git
cd sna-underworld
npm ci
npm run dev
```
After that, browse to `http://localhost:8080` and explore. Open the Javascript console for debug messages. NOTE: The console is formatted for Chrome-based browsers and may look weird on Firefox or Safari.
